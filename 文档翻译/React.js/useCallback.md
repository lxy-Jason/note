# useCallback

`useCallback` is a React Hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders.

```js
const cachedFn = useCallback(fn, dependencies)
```

## Reference 

### `useCallback(fn, dependencies)` 

Call `useCallback` at the top level of your component to cache a function definition between re-renders:

```jsx
import { useCallback } from 'react';

export default function ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {
  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {
    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {
      referrer,
      orderDetails,
    });
  }, [productId, referrer]);
```

[See more examples below.](https://react.dev/reference/react/useCallback#usage)

#### Parameters 

- `fn`: The function value that you want to cache. 

  It can take any arguments and return any values.

  React will return (not call!) your function back to you during the initial render.

   On next renders, React will give you the same function again if the `dependencies` have not changed since the last render.

  Otherwise, it will give you the function that you have passed during the current render, and store it in case it can be reused later. 

  React will not call your function.

  The function is returned to you so you can decide when and whether to call it.

- `dependencies`: The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the `fn` code.

  Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body. 

  If your linter(代码检查工具) is [configured for React](https://react.dev/learn/editor-setup#linting), it will verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a dependency.

  The list of dependencies must have a constant number(确切数量) of items and be written inline like `[dep1, dep2, dep3]`. 

  React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) comparison algorithm.

#### Returns 

On the initial render, `useCallback` returns the `fn` function you have passed.

During subsequent renders, it will either return an already stored `fn`  function from the last render (if the dependencies haven’t changed), or return the `fn` function you have passed during this render.

#### Caveats (警告)

- `useCallback` is a Hook, so you can only call it **at the top level of your component** or your own Hooks.

  You can’t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.

- React **will not throw away the cached function unless there is a specific reason to do that.** 

  For example, in development, React throws away the cache when you edit the file of your component.

  Both in development and in production, React will throw away the cache if your component suspends(暂停) during the initial mount. 

  在未来，React 可能会增加更多利用了丢弃缓存机制的特性。例如，如果 React 未来内置了对虚拟列表的支持，那么在滚动超出虚拟化表视口的item时，抛弃缓存是有意义的。

  This should match your expectations if you rely on `useCallback` as a performance optimization. 

  Otherwise, a [state variable](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState#im-trying-to-set-state-to-a-function-but-it-gets-called-instead) or a [ref](https://react.dev/reference/react/useRef#avoiding-recreating-the-ref-contents) may be more appropriate.

## Usage 

### Skipping re-rendering of components 

When you optimize rendering performance, you will sometimes need to cache the functions that you pass to child components.

 Let’s first look at the syntax for how to do this, and then see in which cases it’s useful.

To cache a function between re-renders of your component, wrap its definition into the `useCallback` Hook:

```jsx
import { useCallback } from 'react';

function ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {
  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {
    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {
      referrer,
      orderDetails,
    });
  }, [productId, referrer]);
  // ...
```

You need to pass two things to `useCallback`:

1. A function definition that you want to cache between re-renders.
2. A list of dependencies including every value within your component that’s used inside your function.

On the initial render, the returned function you’ll get from `useCallback` will be the function you passed.

On the following renders, React will compare the dependencies with the dependencies you passed during the previous render. 

 If none of the dependencies have changed (compared with [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is)), `useCallback` will return the same function as before. 

Otherwise, `useCallback` will return the function you passed on *this* render.

In other words, `useCallback` caches a function between re-renders until its dependencies change.

**Let’s walk through an example to see when this is useful.**

Say you’re passing a `handleSubmit` function down from the `ProductPage` to the `ShippingForm` component:

```jsx
function ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {
  // ...
  return (
    <div className={theme}>
      <ShippingForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />
    </div>
  );
```

You’ve noticed that toggling the `theme` prop freezes(卡顿) the app for a moment, but if you remove `<ShippingForm />` from your JSX, it feels fast. 

This tells you that it’s worth trying to optimize the `ShippingForm` component.

**By default, when a component re-renders, React re-renders all of its children recursively(递归的).** 

This is why, when `ProductPage` re-renders with a different `theme`, the `ShippingForm` component *also* re-renders. 

This is fine for components that don’t require much calculation to re-render. 

But if you verified a re-render is slow, you can tell `ShippingForm` to skip re-rendering when its props are the same as on last render by **wrapping** it in [`memo`](https://react.dev/reference/react/memo):

```jsx
import { memo } from 'react';

const ShippingForm = memo(function ShippingForm({ onSubmit }) { //注意这里是包裹了整个组件
  // ...
});
```

**With this change, `ShippingForm` will skip re-rendering if all of its props are the \*same\* as on the last render.** 

This is when caching a function becomes important!(这就是在缓存函数变得重要的时候！)

 Let’s say you defined `handleSubmit` without `useCallback`:

```jsx
function ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {
  // Every time the theme changes, this will be a different function...
  function handleSubmit(orderDetails) {
    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {
      referrer,
      orderDetails,
    });
  }
  
  return (
    <div className={theme}>
      {/* ... so ShippingForm's props will never be the same, and it will re-render every time */}
      <ShippingForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

**In JavaScript, a `function () {}` or `() => {}` always creates a \*different\* function,** similar to how the `{}` object literal(字面量) always creates a new object. 

Normally, this wouldn’t be a problem, but it means that `ShippingForm` props will never be the same, and your [`memo`](https://react.dev/reference/react/memo) optimization won’t work. 

This is where `useCallback` comes in handy:(这就是useCallback派上用场的地方：)

```jsx
function ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {
  // Tell React to cache your function between re-renders...
  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {
    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {
      referrer,
      orderDetails,
    });
  }, [productId, referrer]); // ...so as long as these dependencies don't change...

  return (
    <div className={theme}>
      {/* ...ShippingForm will receive the same props and can skip re-rendering */}
      <ShippingForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

**By wrapping `handleSubmit` in `useCallback`, you ensure that it’s the \*same\* function between the re-renders** (until dependencies change). 

You don’t *have to* wrap a function in `useCallback` unless you do it for some specific reason. 

In this example, the reason is that you pass it to a component wrapped in [`memo`,](https://react.dev/reference/react/memo) and this lets it skip re-rendering. 

There are other reasons you might need `useCallback` which are described further on this page.

#### The difference between useCallback and declaring a function directly

#### Example 1 of 2: Skipping re-rendering with `useCallback` and `memo` 

在这个例子中，ShippingForm组件被人为地减慢了速度，以便您可以看到当您渲染的React组件真正变慢时会发生什么。

Try incrementing the counter and toggling the theme.

Incrementing the counter feels slow because it forces the slowed down `ShippingForm` to re-render. 

这是预料之中的，因为计数器已经改变了，所以你需要在屏幕上反映用户的新选择。

```jsx
import { memo, useState } from 'react';

const ShippingForm = memo(function ShippingForm({ onSubmit }) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(1);

  console.log('[ARTIFICIALLY SLOW] Rendering <ShippingForm />');
  let startTime = performance.now();
  while (performance.now() - startTime < 500) {
    // Do nothing for 500 ms to emulate extremely slow code
  }

  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    const formData = new FormData(e.target);
    const orderDetails = {
      ...Object.fromEntries(formData),
      count
    };
    onSubmit(orderDetails);
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <p><b>Note: <code>ShippingForm</code> is artificially slowed down!</b></p>
      <label>
        Number of items:
        <button type="button" onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>–</button>
        {count}
        <button type="button" onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+</button>
      </label>
      <label>
        Street:
        <input name="street" />
      </label>
      <label>
        City:
        <input name="city" />
      </label>
      <label>
        Postal code:
        <input name="zipCode" />
      </label>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
});

export default ShippingForm;

```

Next, try toggling the theme. **Thanks to `useCallback` together with [`memo`](https://react.dev/reference/react/memo), it’s fast despite(即使) the artificial(人为的) slowdown!** `ShippingForm` skipped re-rendering because the `handleSubmit` function has not changed. The `handleSubmit` function has not changed because both `productId` and `referrer` (your `useCallback` dependencies) haven’t changed since last render.

```jsx
import { useCallback } from 'react';
import ShippingForm from './ShippingForm.js';

export default function ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {
  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => { //重点
    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {
      referrer,
      orderDetails,
    });
  }, [productId, referrer]);

  return (
    <div className={theme}>
      <ShippingForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />
    </div>
  );
}

function post(url, data) {
  // Imagine this sends a request...
  console.log('POST /' + url);
  console.log(data);
}

```

#### Example 2 of 2: Always re-rendering a component 

In this example, the `ShippingForm` implementation is also **artificially slowed down** so that you can see what happens when some React component you’re rendering is genuinely slow. Try incrementing the counter and toggling the theme.

Unlike in the previous example, toggling the theme is also slow now! 

This is because **there is no `useCallback` call in this version,** so `handleSubmit` is always a new function, and the slowed down `ShippingForm` component can’t skip re-rendering.

```jsx
import ShippingForm from './ShippingForm.js';

export default function ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {
  function handleSubmit(orderDetails) { //重点
    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {
      referrer,
      orderDetails,
    });
  }

  return (
    <div className={theme}>
      <ShippingForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />
    </div>
  );
}

function post(url, data) {
  // Imagine this sends a request...
  console.log('POST /' + url);
  console.log(data);
}
```

Quite often(很多时候), code without memoization works fine. 

 If your interactions are fast enough, you don’t need memoization.

请记住，您需要在生产模式下运行React，禁用React开发者工具，并使用与您的应用程序用户相似的设备，以便真实地了解导致应用程序变慢的原因。

### Updating state from a memoized callback 

Sometimes, you might need to update state based on previous state from a memoized callback.

这个 handleAddTodo 函数将 todos 指定为一个依赖项，因为它从中计算出下一个 todos。

```jsx
function TodoList() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);

  const handleAddTodo = useCallback((text) => {
    const newTodo = { id: nextId++, text };
    setTodos([...todos, newTodo]);
  }, [todos]);
```

通常情况下，您希望具有尽可能少的依赖关系的记忆化函数。

当你只需要读取某个状态来计算下一个状态时，可以通过传递一个更新函数来消除该依赖关系：

```jsx
function TodoList() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);

  const handleAddTodo = useCallback((text) => {
    const newTodo = { id: nextId++, text };
    setTodos(todos => [...todos, newTodo]);
  }, []); // ✅ No need for the todos dependency
  // ...
```

在这里，不是将todos作为依赖项并在内部读取它，而是向React传递一个关于如何更新状态（todos => [...todos, newTodo]）的指令。 [Read more about updater functions.](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState#updating-state-based-on-the-previous-state)

---

### Preventing an Effect from firing too often 

Sometimes, you might want to call a function from inside an [Effect:](https://react.dev/learn/synchronizing-with-effects)

```jsx
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  function createOptions() {
    return {
      serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',
      roomId: roomId
    };
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    const options = createOptions();
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
    // ...
```

This creates a problem. 

 [Every reactive value must be declared as a dependency of your Effect.](https://react.dev/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#react-verifies-that-you-specified-every-reactive-value-as-a-dependency)

However, if you declare `createOptions` as a dependency, it will cause your Effect to constantly reconnect to the chat room:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
    const options = createOptions();
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [createOptions]); // 🔴 Problem: This dependency changes on every render
  // ...
```

To solve this, you can wrap the function you need to call from an Effect into `useCallback`:

```jsx
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  const createOptions = useCallback(() => {
    return {
      serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',
      roomId: roomId
    };
  }, [roomId]); // ✅ Only changes when roomId changes

  useEffect(() => {
    const options = createOptions();
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [createOptions]); // ✅ Only changes when createOptions changes
  // ...
```

This ensures that the `createOptions` function is the same between re-renders if the `roomId` is the same. 

**However, it’s even better to remove the need(依赖) for a function dependency.** 

Move your function *inside* the Effect:

```jsx
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    function createOptions() { // ✅ No need for useCallback or function dependencies!
      return {
        serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',
        roomId: roomId
      };
    }

    const options = createOptions();
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]); // ✅ Only changes when roomId changes
  // ...
```

Now your code is simpler and doesn’t need `useCallback`. 

[Learn more about removing Effect dependencies.](https://react.dev/learn/removing-effect-dependencies#move-dynamic-objects-and-functions-inside-your-effect)

---

### Optimizing a custom Hook 

If you’re writing a [custom Hook,](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks) it’s recommended to wrap **any** functions that it returns into `useCallback`:

```jsx
function useRouter() {
  const { dispatch } = useContext(RouterStateContext);

  const navigate = useCallback((url) => {
    dispatch({ type: 'navigate', url });
  }, [dispatch]);

  const goBack = useCallback(() => {
    dispatch({ type: 'back' });
  }, [dispatch]);

  return {
    navigate,
    goBack,
  };
}
```

This ensures that the consumers of your Hook can optimize their own code when needed.

---

## Troubleshooting 

### Every time my component renders, `useCallback` returns a different function

Make sure you’ve specified the dependency array as a second argument!

If you forget the dependency array, `useCallback` will return a new function every time:

```jsx
function ProductPage({ productId, referrer }) {
  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {
    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {
      referrer,
      orderDetails,
    });
  }); // 🔴 Returns a new function every time: no dependency array
  // ...
```

This is the corrected version passing the dependency array as a second argument:

```jsx
function ProductPage({ productId, referrer }) {
  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {
    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {
      referrer,
      orderDetails,
    });
  }, [productId, referrer]); // ✅ Does not return a new function unnecessarily
  // ...
```

If this doesn’t help, then the problem is that at least one of your dependencies is different from the previous render.

You can debug this problem by manually logging your dependencies to the console:

```jsx
  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {
    // ..
  }, [productId, referrer]);

  console.log([productId, referrer]);
```

然后您可以在控制台上右键单击来自不同重新渲染的数组，并选择把它们都“存储为全局变量”。

Assuming the first one got saved as `temp1` and the second one got saved as `temp2`, you can then use the browser console to check whether each dependency in both arrays is the same:

```jsx
Object.is(temp1[0], temp2[0]); // Is the first dependency the same between the arrays?
Object.is(temp1[1], temp2[1]); // Is the second dependency the same between the arrays?
Object.is(temp1[2], temp2[2]); // ... and so on for every dependency ...
```

When you find which dependency is breaking memoization, either find a way to remove it, or [memoize it as well.](https://react.dev/reference/react/useMemo#memoizing-a-dependency-of-another-hook)

### I need to call `useCallback` for each list item in a loop, but it’s not allowed 

Suppose(假设) the `Chart` component is wrapped in [`memo`](https://react.dev/reference/react/memo). 

You want to skip re-rendering every `Chart` in the list when the `ReportList` component re-renders. However, you can’t call `useCallback` in a loop:

```jsx
function ReportList({ items }) {
  return (
    <article>
      {items.map(item => {
        // 🔴 You can't call useCallback in a loop like this:
        const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
          sendReport(item)
        }, [item]);

        return (
          <figure key={item.id}>
            <Chart onClick={handleClick} />
          </figure>
        );
      })}
    </article>
  );
}
```

Instead, extract a component for an individual item, and put `useCallback` there:

```jsx
function ReportList({ items }) {
  return (
    <article>
      {items.map(item =>
        <Report key={item.id} item={item} />
      )}
    </article>
  );
}

function Report({ item }) {
  // ✅ Call useCallback at the top level:
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    sendReport(item)
  }, [item]);

  return (
    <figure>
      <Chart onClick={handleClick} />
    </figure>
  );
}
```

Alternatively(或者), you could remove `useCallback` in the last snippet(片段) and instead wrap `Report` itself in [`memo`.](https://react.dev/reference/react/memo)

```jsx
function ReportList({ items }) {
  // ...
}

const Report = memo(function Report({ item }) {
  function handleClick() {
    sendReport(item);
  }

  return (
    <figure>
      <Chart onClick={handleClick} />
    </figure>
  );
});
```
