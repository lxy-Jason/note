# React Reference Overview

This section provides detailed reference documentation for working with React.

 For an introduction to React, please visit the [Learn](https://react.dev/learn) section.

我们的React参考文档被分成了功能性的子部分：

## React 

编程式的React特性：

- [Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks) - Use different React features from your components.
- [Components](https://react.dev/reference/react/components) - Documents(记录) built-in components that you can use in your JSX
- [APIs](https://react.dev/reference/react/apis) - APIs that are useful for defining components.
- [Directives](https://react.dev/reference/react/directives) - 为与 React 服务器组件兼容的捆绑器提供指示。

## React DOM 

React-dom contains features that are only supported for web applications (which run in the browser DOM environment). 

This section is broken into the following:

- [Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/hooks) - Hooks for web applications which run in the browser DOM environment.
- [Components](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components) - React supports all of the browser built-in HTML and SVG components.
- [APIs](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom) - The `react-dom` package contains methods supported only in web applications.
- [Client APIs](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client) - The `react-dom/client` APIs let you render React components on the client (in the browser).
- [Server APIs](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/server) - The `react-dom/server` APIs let you render React components to HTML on the server.

## Legacy APIs (传统API?)

- [Legacy APIs](https://react.dev/reference/react/legacy) - 从react包中导出，但不建议在新编写的代码中使用。
